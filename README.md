# Summary
In this lesson, we'll work with the full wildlife dataset, which has eight classes. This is more than the network in the previous notebook can handle. Here we'll build and train a more complicated neural network, called a Convolutional Neural Network, that is meant for working with images. We'll use this network to get the predictions we need for the competition at DrivenData.org.

## Objectives
- Read in data with multiple classes
- Normalize our data to improve performance
- Create a Convolutional Neural Network that works well with images
- Train that network to do multiclass classification
- Reformat the network predictions to complete the competition

## New Terms
- Multiclass
- Normalize
- Convolution
- Max pooling
